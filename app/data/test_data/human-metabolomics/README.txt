USING THE EXAMPLE DATASET WITH METABOVERSE
==========================================

Included in this test dataset are the following files:
- lung_tumor_vs_normal_measurements.txt
      GC-TOF metabolomics for paired tumor and normal lung tissue of the LUAD dataset (Wikoff, 2015) as used in the Metaboverse manuscript vignette. This dataset provides log2 Fold Change and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values for each measured entity, and should be provided on the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse.

1) On the CURATION page of Metaboverse, select Homo sapiens as the model organism.   
2) On the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse, you would specify the experiment type as "Default (2-condition)".
