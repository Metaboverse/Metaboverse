USING THE EXAMPLE DATASET WITH METABOVERSE
==========================================

Included in this test dataset are the following files:
- proteomics_male_female_log.txt
    Proteomics for male vs female zebrafish (Li, 2016). This dataset provides log10 transformed quantifications for each biological replicate between the two measured conditions. These data should be used as practice for the "Format dataset" tool on the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse.

1) On the Curation page of Metaboverse, select *Danio rerio* as the model organism.
2) On the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse, you would launch the "Format dataset" tool and upload the file to generate the log2 Fold Change and p-values for your comparison conditions.
3) On the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse, you would specify the experiment type as "Default (2-condition)".
