STATegra, a comprehensive multi-omics dataset of B-cell differentiation in mouse. Sci Data. 2019 Oct 31;6(1):256. doi: 10.1038/s41597-019-0202-7. PMID: 31672995; PMCID: PMC6823427.

Included in this test dataset are the following files:
- proteomics_formatted.txt
      Proteomics for the timecourse of B-cell differentiation in mouse. This dataset provides log2 Fold Change and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values for each measured entity at each time-point, and should be provided on the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse.
- metabolomics_combined.txt 
      A combination of GC- and LC-MS metabolomics data for the timecourse of B-cell differentiation in mouse. This dataset provides log2 Fold Change and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values for each measured entity at each time-point, and should be provided on the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse.

1) On the CURATION page of Metaboverse, select Mus musculus as the model organism.   
2) On the VARIABLES AND DATA page of Metaboverse, you would specify the experiment type as "Time-Course", and would provide labels such as "0hr, 2hr, 6hr, 12hr, 18hr, 24hr".
