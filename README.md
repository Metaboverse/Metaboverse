## What does Metaboverse do?
Integrating multi- or single-omic metabolic data upon the metabolic network can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Metaboverse seeks to simplify this task for users by providing a simple, user-friendly interface for layering their data on a dynamic representation of the metabolic network and automatically searching the network for interesting regulatory or other patterns. Additionally, Metaboverse provides several tools to enable the contextualization of metabolic data.

## Getting started

### Requirements
- An internet connection for network curation
- The most current version of the [Metaboverse app](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/releases) for your operating system
- A Linux/macOS/Windows 64-bit operating system
- At least 4 GB RAM and 5 GB of free storage space

### Installation
- Download the appropriate Metaboverse app `.zip` file for your operating system from [this location](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/releases/latest).
- Unzip the downloaded folder
- Open the `Metaboverse` app
- Please refer to the [documentation](https://metaboverse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/walkthrough.html) for more information in using the app.
- If you would like to use an example dataset, this is labeled `test_data.zip` and can be found within the `Metaboverse` app folder.

### Testing out Metaboverse
With each release archive or Metaboverse, a `test_data.zip` file is included. Unzip this file and read the `README.txt` file for more information on this example dataset. 

## Getting Help
- If you have questions, requests, or bugs to report, please use the [Metaboverse issues forum](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/issues). - Please clearly describe the problem, what you have tried, as well as screenshots of any error information.     
- Generally, for any errors occurring during network building, a file named `metaboverse_session.log` will be output to your specified Output folder. If you receive this file, please upload it to your GitHub Issue. This will output a lot of information, but you can try self-diagnosing by seeing if there is anything in the last ~10-15 lines of this file that might hint at the issue. Otherwise, we are happy to help diagnose the problem!    
- It is also often helpful for us to click on the `View` menu tab, click `Toggle Developer Tools`, click the `Console` tab of the window that opens, and take a screenshot of the output in this panel.

## Feedback
- Have any feedback? Let us know [here](https://github.com/Metaboverse/Metaboverse/issues).
