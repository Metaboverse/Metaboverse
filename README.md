## What does Metaboverse do?
A current draft of the manuscript describing Metaboverse can be found here:
```

```
Briefly,    
```
Metabolism and other biological interactions and reactions are complex, each
with variable inputs, outputs, and modifiers. The harmony between these factors
consequently determines the health and stability of a cell or organism.
Perturbations to these components often have rippling downstream effects. These
effects can be difficult to trace across the global reaction network,
particularly when the effects occur between canonical representations of
pathways. Researchers have primarily utilized reductionist approaches to
understanding these systems; however, these methods are limit the scope of the
analysis. Even the power of systems-centric -omics approaches can be limited
when only a  handful of high magnitude signals in the data are prioritized. To
address these challenges, we developed Metaboverse, an interactive desktop app
for the exploration and automated extraction of potential regulatory events,
patterns, and trends from multi-omic data within the context of the metabolic
network and other global reaction networks. This framework will be foundational
in increasing our ability to holistically understand static and temporal
metabolic events and shifts and gene-metabolite intra-cooperativity.
